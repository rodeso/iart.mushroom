    "Using the previously balanced dataset, we will apply various supervised learning algorithms to build a model that can accurately classify mushrooms as poisonous or edible. The dataset will be split into training and testing sets, and the models will be evaluated based on their performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. We will use Decision Trees, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Support Vector Machines (SVM) as our classification algorithms. The models will be trained on the training set and evaluated on the testing set to assess their generalization performance. Additionally, we will perform hyperparameter tuning to optimize the models for better accuracy."
